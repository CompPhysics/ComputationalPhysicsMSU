===== Important Matrix and vector handling packages =====

The Numerical Recipes codes have been rewritten in Fortran 90/95 and
C/C++ by us.  The original source codes are taken from the widely used
software package LAPACK, which follows two other popular packages
developed in the 1970s, namely EISPACK and LINPACK.

  * LINPACK: package for linear equations and least square problems.
  * LAPACK:package for solving symmetric, unsymmetric and generalized eigenvalue problems. From LAPACK's website URL: "http://www.netlib.org" it is possible to download for free all source codes from this library. Both C/C++ and Fortran versions are available.
  * BLAS (I, II and III): (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. Blas I is vector operations, II vector-matrix operations and III matrix-matrix operations. Highly parallelized and efficient codes, all available for download from URL: "http://www.netlib.org".

===== Matrix Handling in C/C++, Static and Dynamical allocation =====

!bblock Static
We have  an $N\times N$ matrix A  with $N=100$
In C/C++ this would be  defined as

!bc cppcod
   int N = 100;
   double A[100][100];
   //   initialize all elements to zero
   for(i=0 ; i < N ; i++) {
      for(j=0 ; j < N ; j++) {
         A[i][j] = 0.0;

Note the way the matrix is organized, row-major order.

In C/C++ this would be coded like

===== Armadillo, recommended!! =====

  * Armadillo is a C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths) aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. The syntax is deliberately similar to Matlab.
  * Integer, floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are provided through optional integration with LAPACK, or one of its high performance drop-in replacements (such as the multi-threaded MKL or ACML libraries).
  * A delayed evaluation approach is employed (at compile-time) to combine several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) the need for temporaries. This is accomplished through recursive templates and template meta-programming.
  * Useful for conversion of research code into production environments, or if C++ has been decided as the language of choice, due to speed and/or integration capabilities.
  * The library is open-source software, and is distributed under a license that is useful in both open-source and commercial/proprietary contexts.

===== Armadillo, simple examples =====

!bc cppcod
#include <iostream>
#include <armadillo>

using namespace std;
using namespace arma;

int main(int argc, char** argv)

===== Armadillo, how to compile and install =====

For people using Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, simply go to the synaptic package manager and install
armadillo from there.
You may have to install Lapack as well.
For Mac and Windows users, follow the instructions from the webpage
URL: "http://arma.sourceforge.net".
To compile, use for example (linux/ubuntu)

!bc cppcod
c++ -O2 -o program.x program.cpp  -larmadillo -llapack -lblas
!ec
where the `-l` option indicates the library you wish to link to.

For OS X users you may have to declare the paths to the include files and the libraries as
!bc cppcod
c++ -O2 -o program.x program.cpp  -L/usr/local/lib -I/usr/local/include -larmadillo -llapack -lblas

===== Gaussian Elimination =====

The basic idea of Gaussian elimination is to use the first equation to eliminate the first unknown $x_1$
from the remaining $n-1$ equations. Then we use the new second equation to eliminate the second unknown
$x_2$ from the remaining $n-2$ equations. With $n-1$ such eliminations
we obtain a so-called upper triangular set of equations of the form

!bt
\begin{align}
 b_{11}x_1 +b_{12}x_2 +b_{13}x_3 + b_{14}x_4=&y_1 \nonumber \\
 b_{22}x_2 + b_{23}x_3 + b_{24}x_4=&y_2 \nonumber \\
b_{33}x_3 + b_{34}x_4=&y_3 \nonumber \\
b_{44}x_4=&y_4. \nonumber
label{eq:gaussbacksub}
\end{align}
!et
We can solve this system of equations recursively starting from $x_n$ (in our case $x_4$) and proceed with
what is called a backward substitution. 

!split
===== Gaussian Elimination =====
This process can be expressed mathematically as

!bt
\begin{equation}
   x_m = \frac{1}{b_{mm}}\left(y_m-\sum_{k=m+1}^nb_{mk}x_k\right)\quad m=n-1,n-2,\dots,1.
\end{equation}
!et
To arrive at such an upper triangular system of equations, we start by eliminating
the unknown $x_1$ for $j=2,n$. We achieve this by multiplying the first equation by $a_{j1}/a_{11}$ and then subtract
the result from the $j$th equation. We assume obviously that $a_{11}\ne 0$ and that
$\mathbf{A}$ is not singular.

!split
===== Gaussian Elimination =====

Our actual $4\times 4$ example reads after the first operation

\begin{bmatrix}
                           a_{11}& a_{12} &a_{13}& a_{14}\\

0& (a_{32}-\frac{a_{31}a_{12}}{a_{11}})& (a_{33}-\frac{a_{31}a_{13}}{a_{11}})& (a_{34}-\frac{a_{31}a_{14}}{a_{11}})\\

This set of $n-1$ elimations leads us to an equations which is solved by back substitution.
If the arithmetics is exact and the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is not singular, then the computed answer will be exact.

Even though the matrix elements along the diagonal are not zero,
numerically small numbers may appear and subsequent divisions may lead to large numbers, which, if added
to a small number may yield losses of precision. Suppose for example that our first division in $(a_{22}-a_{21}a_{12}/a_{11})$
results in $-10^{-7}$ and that $a_{22}$ is one.

adding $10^7+1$. With single precision this results in $10^7$.

Suppose we want to solve the following boundary value equation

\[
  -\frac{d^2u(x)}{dx^2} = f(x,u(x)),
\]
!et
with $x\in (a,b)$ and with boundary conditions $u(a)=u(b) = 0$.
We assume that $f$ is a continuous function in the domain $x\in (a,b)$.
Since, except the few cases where it is possible to find analytic solutions, we
will seek after approximate solutions, we choose to represent the approximation to the second derivative
from the previous chapter

!bt
\[
  f''=\frac{f_h -2f_0 +f_{-h}}{h^2} +O(h^2).

We subdivide our interval $x\in (a,b)$ into $n$ subintervals by setting $x_i = ih$, with $i=0,1,\dots,n+1$.
The step size is then given by $h=(b-a)/(n+1)$ with $n\in {\mathbb{N}}$.
For the internal grid points $i=1,2,\dots n$ we replace the differential operator with the above formula
resulting in

!bt
\[
u''(x_i) \approx  \frac{u(x_i+h) -2u(x_i) +u(x_i-h)}{h^2},

$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{u}) = f(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n,u_1, u_2, \dots,u_n)^T$  we can rewrite the differential equation

===== Gaussian Elimination and Tridiagonal matrices, project 1 =====

A tridiagonal matrix is a special form of banded matrix where all the elements are zero except for
those on and immediately above and below the leading diagonal.
The above tridiagonal system   can be written as

!bt
\[
  a_iu_{i-1}+b_iu_i+c_iu_{i+1} = f_i,
\]
!et
for $i=1,2,\dots,n$. We see that $u_{-1}$ and $u_{n+1}$ are not required and we can set $a_1=c_n=0$.
In many applications the matrix is symmetric and we have $a_i=c_i$.
The algorithm for solving this set of equations is rather simple and requires two steps only,
a forward substitution and a backward substitution. These steps are also
common to the algorithms based on
Gaussian elimination that
we discussed previously. However, due to its simplicity, the number of floating point operations
is in this
case proportional with $O(n)$ while Gaussian elimination requires $2n^3/3+O(n^2)$ floating point operations.

!split
===== Gaussian Elimination and Tridiagonal matrices, project 1 =====

In case your system of equations leads to a tridiagonal matrix, it is clearly an overkill to employ
Gaussian elimination or the standard LU decomposition.

Our algorithm starts with forward substitution with a loop over of the elements $i$ and gives an update of the diagonal elements $b_i$
given by the new diagonals $\tilde{b}_i$
!bt
\[
\tilde{b}_i= b_i - \frac{a_ic_{i-1}}{\tilde{b}_{i-1}},
\]
!et
and the new righthand side $\tilde{f}_i$ given by
!bt
\[
\tilde{f}_i= f_i - \frac{a_i\tilde{f}_{i-1}}{\tilde{b}_{i-1}}.
\]
!et
Recall that $\tilde{b}_1=b_1$ and $\tilde{f}_1=f_1$ always.

!split
===== Backward substitution =====

The backward substitution gives then the final solution
!bt
\[
u_{i-1}= \frac{\tilde{f}_{i-1}-c_{i-1}u_i}{\tilde{b}_{i-1}},
\]
!et
with $u_n=\tilde{f}_{n}/\tilde{b}_{n}$ when $i=n$, the last point.


!split
===== Gaussian Elimination and Tridiagonal matrices, project 1 =====

The matrix $\mathbf{A}$ which rephrases a second derivative in a discretized form is much simpler than the general matrix
!bt
\[
    \mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
                          2 & -1 & 0 & 0  &0  & 0\\
                          -1 & 2 & -1 &0 &0 &0 \\
                          0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0& 0 \\
                          0 & \dots   & \dots & \dots   &\dots & \dots \\
                          0 &0   &0  &-1  &2& -1 \\
                          0 &  0  &0  &0   &-1 & 2 \\
                      \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
This matrix fulfills the condition of a weak dominance of the diagonal, with
$|b_1| > |c_1|$, $|b_n| > |a_n|$ and  $|b_k| \ge |a_k|+|c_k|$ for $k=2,3,\dots,n-1$.
This is a relevant but not sufficient condition to guarantee that the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ yields a solution to a linear
equation problem. The matrix needs also to be irreducible. A tridiagonal irreducible matrix means that all the elements $a_i$ and
$c_i$ are non-zero. If these two conditions are present, then $\mathbf{A}$ is nonsingular and has a unique LU decomposition.

!split
===== Project 1, hints =====

When setting up the algo it is useful to note that the different
operations on the matrix (here as a $4\times 4$ case  with diagonals
$d_i$ and off-diagonals $e_i$) give is an extremely simple algorithm, namely
!bt
\[
   \begin{bmatrix}
                          d_1 & e_1 & 0 & 0 \\
                          e_2 & d_2 & e_2 & 0 \\
                          0 & e_3 & d_3 & e_3 \\
                          0 & 0 & e_4 & d_4
                      \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow
                 \begin{bmatrix}
                          d_1 & e_1 & 0 & 0 \\
                          0 & \tilde{d}_2 & e_2 & 0 \\
                          0 & e_3 & d_3 & e_3 \\
                          0 & 0 & e_4 & d_4
                      \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow
                \begin{bmatrix}
                          d_1 & e_1 & 0 & 0 \\
                          0 & \tilde{d}_2 & e_2 & 0 \\
                          0 & 0 & \tilde{d}_3 & e_3 \\
                          0 & 0 & e_4 & d_4
                      \end{bmatrix}
\]
!et
and finally

!bt
\[
                      \begin{bmatrix}
                          d_1 & e_1 & 0 & 0 \\

                          0 & 0 & \tilde{d}_3 & e_3 \\
                          0 & 0 & 0 & \tilde{d}_4
                      \end{bmatrix}
\]
!et

!split
===== Project 1, hints =====

                      \end{bmatrix}

!et
The matrices we often end up with in rewriting for for example partial differential equations,
have the feature that all leading principal submatrices are non-singular. 


!split
===== Simple expressions for project 1 =====
For the special matrix we can can actually precalculate the updated matrix elements $\tilde{d}_i$. The non-diagonal elements $e_i$ are unchanged.
For our particular matrix in project 1 we have 
!bt
\[
\tilde{d}_i= 2 - \frac{1}{\tilde{d}_{i-1}}=\frac{i+1}{i},
\]
!et
and the new righthand side $\tilde{f}_i$ given by
!bt
\[
\tilde{f}_i= f_i + \frac{(i-1)\tilde{f}_{i-1}}{i}.
\]
!et
Recall that $\tilde{d}_1=2$ and $\tilde{f}_1=f_1$.  These arrays can be set up before computing $u$. 

The backward substitution gives then the final solution
!bt
\[
u_{i-1}= \frac{i-1}{i}\left(\tilde{f}_{i-1}-u_i\right),
\]
!et
with $u_n=\tilde{f}_{n}/\tilde{b}_{n}$.

===== LU Decomposition =====

LU decomposition forms the backbone of other algorithms in linear algebra, such as the
solution of linear equations given by

!bt
\begin{align}
 a_{11}x_1 +a_{12}x_2 +a_{13}x_3 + a_{14}x_4=&w_1 \nonumber \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 + a_{24}x_4=&w_2 \nonumber \\
a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 + a_{34}x_4=&w_3 \nonumber \\
a_{41}x_1 + a_{42}x_2 + a_{43}x_3 + a_{44}x_4=&w_4.  \nonumber
\end{align}
!et
The above set of equations is conveniently solved by using LU decomposition as an intermediate step.

The matrix $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ has an LU factorization if the determinant
is different from zero. If the LU factorization exists and $\mathbf{A}$ is non-singular, then the LU factorization
is unique and the determinant is given by

!bt
\[
det\{\mathbf{A}\}=det\{\mathbf{LU}\}= det\{\mathbf{L}\}det\{\mathbf{U}\}=u_{11}u_{22}\dots u_{nn}.
\]
!et

!split
===== LU Decomposition, why? =====

There are at least three main advantages with LU decomposition compared with standard Gaussian elimination:

  * It is straightforward to compute the determinant of a matrix
  * If we have to solve sets of linear equations with the same matrix but with different vectors $\mathbf{y}$, the number of FLOPS is of the order $n^3$.
  * The inverse is such an operation 

!split
===== LU Decomposition, linear equations =====

With the LU decomposition it is rather
simple to solve a system of linear equations

!bt
\begin{align}
 a_{11}x_1 +a_{12}x_2 +a_{13}x_3 + a_{14}x_4=&w_1 \nonumber \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 + a_{24}x_4=&w_2 \nonumber \\
a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 + a_{34}x_4=&w_3 \nonumber \\
a_{41}x_1 + a_{42}x_2 + a_{43}x_3 + a_{44}x_4=&w_4. \nonumber
\end{align}
!et

This can be written in matrix form as

!bt
\[ \mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{w}. \]
!et

where $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ are known and we have to solve for
$\mathbf{x}$. Using the LU dcomposition we write

!bt
\[ \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} \equiv \mathbf{L} \mathbf{U} \mathbf{x} =\mathbf{w}. \]
!et

!split
===== LU Decomposition, linear equations =====

The previous equation can be calculated in two steps

!bt
\[ \mathbf{L} \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{w};\qquad \mathbf{Ux}=\mathbf{y}. \]
!et

To show that this is correct we use to the LU decomposition
to rewrite our system of linear equations as

!bt
\[  \mathbf{LUx}=\mathbf{w}, \]
!et
and since the determinat of $\mathbf{L}$ is equal to 1 (by construction
since the diagonals of $\mathbf{L}$ equal 1) we can use the inverse of
$\mathbf{L}$ to obtain

!bt
\[
   \mathbf{Ux}=\mathbf{L^{-1}w}=\mathbf{y},
\]
!et
which yields the intermediate step

!bt
\[
   \mathbf{L^{-1}w}=\mathbf{y}
\]
!et
and as soon as we have $\mathbf{y}$ we can obtain $\mathbf{x}$
through $\mathbf{Ux}=\mathbf{y}$.

!split
===== LU Decomposition, why? =====

For our four-dimentional example this takes the form

!bt
\begin{align}
 y_1=&w_1 \nonumber\\
l_{21}y_1 + y_2=&w_2\nonumber \\
l_{31}y_1 + l_{32}y_2 + y_3 =&w_3\nonumber \\
l_{41}y_1 + l_{42}y_2 + l_{43}y_3 + y_4=&w_4. \nonumber
\end{align}
!et

and

!bt
\begin{align}
 u_{11}x_1 +u_{12}x_2 +u_{13}x_3 + u_{14}x_4=&y_1 \nonumber\\
u_{22}x_2 + u_{23}x_3 + u_{24}x_4=&y_2\nonumber \\
u_{33}x_3 + u_{34}x_4=&y_3\nonumber \\
u_{44}x_4=&y_4  \nonumber
\end{align}
!et

This example shows the basis for the algorithm
needed to solve the set of $n$ linear equations.

!split
===== LU Decomposition, linear equations =====

The algorithm goes as follows

  * Set up the matrix $\bf A$ and the vector $\bf w$ with their correct dimensions. This determines the dimensionality of the unknown vector $\bf x$.
  * Then LU decompose the matrix $\bf A$ through a call to the function `ludcmp(double a, int n, int indx, double &d)`. This functions returns the LU decomposed matrix $\bf A$, its determinant and the vector indx which keeps track of the number of interchanges of rows. If the determinant is zero, the solution is malconditioned.
  * Thereafter you call the function  `lubksb(double a, int n, int indx, double w)` which uses the LU decomposed matrix $\bf A$ and the vector $\bf w$ and returns $\bf x$ in the same place as $\bf w$. Upon exit the original content in $\bf w$ is destroyed. If you wish to keep this information, you should make a backup of it in your calling function.

!split
===== LU Decomposition, the inverse of a matrix =====

If the inverse exists then

!bt
\[
   \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{I},
\]
!et
the identity matrix. With an LU decomposed matrix we can rewrite the last equation as

!bt
\[
   \mathbf{LU}\mathbf{A}^{-1}=\mathbf{I}.
\]
!et

!split
===== LU Decomposition, the inverse of a matrix =====

If we assume that the first column (that is column 1) of the inverse matrix
can be written as a vector with unknown entries

!bt
\[
    \mathbf{A}_1^{-1}= \begin{bmatrix}

                              a_{11}^{-1} \\
                              a_{21}^{-1} \\
                              \dots \\
                              a_{n1}^{-1} \\
                    \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
then we have a linear set of equations

!bt
\[
    \mathbf{LU}\begin{bmatrix}

                              a_{11}^{-1} \\
                              a_{21}^{-1} \\
                              \dots \\
                              a_{n1}^{-1} \\
                    \end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix}
                               1 \\
                              0 \\
                              \dots \\
                              0 \\
                    \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== LU Decomposition, the inverse =====

In a similar way we can compute the unknow entries of the second column,

!bt
\[
    \mathbf{LU}\begin{bmatrix}

                              a_{12}^{-1} \\
                              a_{22}^{-1} \\
                              \dots \\
                              a_{n2}^{-1} \\
                    \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
                                0 \\
                              1 \\
                              \dots \\
                              0 \\
                    \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

It is an iterative scheme where we start with a guess for the unknown, and 
after $k+1$ iterations we have  
!bt
\[ 
\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)}= \mathbf{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{b}-(\mathbf{L}+\mathbf{U})\mathbf{x}^{(k)}),

$\mathbf{D}$ being a diagonal matrix, $\mathbf{U}$ an upper triangular matrix and $\mathbf{L}$ a  lower triangular

    \mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} = (D+\omega L)^{-1} \big(\omega \mathbf{b} - [\omega U + (\omega-1) D ] \mathbf{x}^{(k)}\big).

However, by taking advantage of the triangular form of $(D+\omega L)$, the elements of $x^{(k+1)}$ can be computed sequentially using forward substitution:
!bt
\[
    x^{(k+1)}_i = (1-\omega)x^{(k)}_i + \frac{\omega}{a_{ii}} \left(b_i - \sum_{j > i} a_{ij}x^{(k)}_j - \sum_{j < i} a_{ij}x^{(k+1)}_j \right),\quad i=1,2,\ldots,n. 
\]
!et
The choice of relaxation factor is not necessarily easy, and depends upon the properties of the coefficient matrix. For symmetric, positive-definite matrices it can be proven that $0 < \omega < 2$ will lead to convergence, but we are generally interested in faster convergence rather than just convergence.

===== Cubic Splines, Chapter 6 =====
!bblock
Cubic spline interpolation is among one of the most used 
methods for interpolating between data points where the arguments
are organized as ascending series. In the library program we supply
such a function, based on the so-called cubic spline method to be 
described below. 

A spline function consists of polynomial pieces defined on
subintervals. The different subintervals are connected via
various continuity relations.

Assume we have at our disposal $n+1$ points $x_0, x_1, \dots x_n$ 
arranged so that $x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < \dots x_{n-1} < x_n$ (such points are called
knots). A spline function $s$ of degree $k$ with $n+1$ knots is defined
as follows
 * On every subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_i)$ *s* is a polynomial of degree $\le k$.
 * $s$ has $k-1$ continuous derivatives in the whole interval $[x_0,x_n]$.

As an example, consider a spline function of degree $k=1$ defined as follows
!bt
\[
    s(x)=\begin{bmatrix} s_0(x)=a_0x+b_0 & x\in [x_0, x_1) \\   
                             s_1(x)=a_1x+b_1 & x\in [x_1, x_2) \\   
                             \dots & \dots \\
                             s_{n-1}(x)=a_{n-1}x+b_{n-1} & x\in 
                             [x_{n-1}, x_n] \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
In this case the polynomial consists of series of straight lines 
connected to each other at every endpoint. The number of continuous
derivatives is then $k-1=0$, as expected when we deal with straight lines.
Such a polynomial is quite easy to construct given
$n+1$ points $x_0, x_1, \dots x_n$ and their corresponding 
function values.

The most commonly used spline function is the one with $k=3$, the so-called
cubic spline function. 
Assume that we have in adddition to the $n+1$ knots a series of
functions values $y_0=f(x_0), y_1=f(x_1), \dots y_n=f(x_n)$.
By definition, the polynomials $s_{i-1}$ and $s_i$ 
are thence supposed to interpolate the same point $i$, that is
!bt
\[
    s_{i-1}(x_i)= y_i = s_i(x_i),
\]
!et
with $1 \le i \le n-1$. In total we have $n$ polynomials of the 
type
!bt
\[
    s_i(x)=a_{i0}+a_{i1}x+a_{i2}x^2+a_{i2}x^3,
\]
!et
yielding $4n$ coefficients to determine.

Every subinterval provides in addition the $2n$ conditions

and

to be fulfilled. If we also assume that $s'$ and $s''$ are continuous,
then
!bt
\[
       s'_{i-1}(x_i)= s'_i(x_i),
\]
!et
yields $n-1$ conditions. Similarly,
!bt
\[
       s''_{i-1}(x_i)= s''_i(x_i),
\]
!et
results in additional $n-1$ conditions. In total we have $4n$ coefficients
and $4n-2$ equations to determine them, leaving us with $2$ degrees of 
freedom to be determined.

Using the last equation we define two values for the second derivative, namely
!bt
\[
       s''_{i}(x_i)= f_i,
\]
!et
and
!bt 
\[
       s''_{i}(x_{i+1})= f_{i+1},
\]
!et
and setting up a straight line between $f_i$ and $f_{i+1}$ we have
!bt
\[
   s_i''(x) = \frac{f_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i}(x_{i+1}-x)+
               \frac{f_{i+1}}{x_{i+1}-x_i}(x-x_i),
\]
!et
and integrating twice one obtains
!bt
\[
   s_i(x) = \frac{f_i}{6(x_{i+1}-x_i)}(x_{i+1}-x)^3+
               \frac{f_{i+1}}{6(x_{i+1}-x_i)}(x-x_i)^3
             +c(x-x_i)+d(x_{i+1}-x).

Using the conditions $s_i(x_i)=y_i$ and $s_i(x_{i+1})=y_{i+1}$ 
we can in turn determine the constants $c$ and $d$ resulting in
!bt
\begin{align}
   s_i(x) =&\frac{f_i}{6(x_{i+1}-x_i)}(x_{i+1}-x)^3+
               \frac{f_{i+1}}{6(x_{i+1}-x_i)}(x-x_i)^3 \nonumber  \\ 
            +&(\frac{y_{i+1}}{x_{i+1}-x_i}-\frac{f_{i+1}(x_{i+1}-x_i)}{6})
              (x-x_i)+
             (\frac{y_{i}}{x_{i+1}-x_i}-\frac{f_{i}(x_{i+1}-x_i)}{6})
             (x_{i+1}-x).

How to determine the values of the second
derivatives $f_{i}$ and $f_{i+1}$? We use the continuity assumption 
of the first derivatives 
!bt
\[
    s'_{i-1}(x_i)= s'_i(x_i),
\]
!et
and set $x=x_i$. Defining $h_i=x_{i+1}-x_i$ we obtain finally
the following expression
!bt
\[
   h_{i-1}f_{i-1}+2(h_{i}+h_{i-1})f_i+h_if_{i+1}=
   \frac{6}{h_i}(y_{i+1}-y_i)-\frac{6}{h_{i-1}}(y_{i}-y_{i-1}),
\]
!et
and introducing the shorthands $u_i=2(h_{i}+h_{i-1})$, 
$v_i=\frac{6}{h_i}(y_{i+1}-y_i)-\frac{6}{h_{i-1}}(y_{i}-y_{i-1})$,
we can reformulate the problem as a set of linear equations to be 
solved  through e.g., Gaussian elemination

The functions supplied in the program library are *spline* and *splint*.
In order to use cubic spline interpolation you need first to call  
!bc cppcod
spline(double x[], double y[], int n, double yp1,  double yp2, double y2[])
!ec
This function takes as
input $x[0,..,n - 1]$ and $y[0,..,n - 1]$ containing a tabulation
$y_i = f(x_i)$ with $x_0 < x_1 < .. < x_{n - 1}$ 
together with the 
first derivatives  of $f(x)$ at $x_0$ and $x_{n-1}$, respectively. Then the
function returns $y2[0,..,n-1]$ which contains the second derivatives of
$f(x_i)$ at each point $x_i$. $n$ is the number of points.
This function provides the cubic spline interpolation for all subintervals
and is called only once.

Thereafter, if you wish to make  various interpolations, you need to call the function 
!bc cppcod
splint(double x[], double y[], double y2a[], int n, double x, double *y)
!ec
which takes as input
the tabulated values $x[0,..,n - 1]$ and $y[0,..,n - 1]$ and the output 
y2a[0,..,n - 1] from *spline*. It returns the value $y$ corresponding
to the point $x$.
