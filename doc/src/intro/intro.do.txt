===== Overview of first week =====

!bblock
  * Tuesday (most likely):
   o Presentation of the course, aims and content
   o Introduction to C++ programming and numerical precision. Exercises for first week. 
   o Numerical differentiation and loss of numerical precision (chapter 3 lecture notes)
  * Computer lab: Thursday (most likely)
   o The first two weeks we focus on simple programming tasks, start to look at project 1 and to set up the software "Git":"https://git-scm.com/" and a repository at "Github":"https://github.com/" as well as  "Qt Creator":"https://www.qt.io/ide/" as one possible IDE. This week we discuss how to set up Git and obtain a Github account.

"Please take the survey. Hopefully this information will allow us to tailor the course to your interests and background.":"http://compphysics.github.io/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/doc/web/compphys.html"

===== Lectures and ComputerLab =====

!bblock
  * Lectures: Most likely Tuesdays from 3pm to 5pm (As of now not determined)
  * Weekly reading assignments needed to solve projects.
  * First hour of each lab session may be used to discuss technicalities, address questions etc linked with projects.
  * Detailed lecture notes, exercises, all programs presented, projects etc can be found at the Github address of the course.
  * Computerlab: Most likely Thursdays. We have reserved a time slot from 3pm to 7pm.
  * Weekly plans and all other information are the github address of the course.
  * Four projects, all have to be approved. The first project is pass/not passed only while the last three projects are graded and count 25% each of the final mark.  The course ends with a final oral exam where you present a project of your choice. The final oral exam accounts for the remaining 25% of the final grade.

===== Course Format =====

!bblock
  * Use version control like  "Git":"https://github.com/" for repository and all your material.
  * C/C++ is the default programming language, but Fortran2008 and Python are also used. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and "github address":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics1/tree/master/doc/Programs" of the course. We recommend either C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python as languages.
