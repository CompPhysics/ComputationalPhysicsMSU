===== Topics we have covered this year =====
* Linear algebra and eigenvalue problems. (Lecture notes chapters 6.1-6.5  and 7.1-7.5 and projects 1 and 2).
* Ordinary differential equations (Lecture notes chapter 8  and projects 3 and 4 )
* Partial differential equations (Lecture notes chapter 10 and project 4)
* Monte Carlo methods in physics (Lecture notes chapters 11, 12 and 13, project 4)

!split
===== Linear algebra and eigenvalue problems, chapters 6.1-6.5 and 7.1-7.5 =====
* Know Gaussian elimination and LU decomposition   (project 1)
* How to solve linear equations   (project 1)
* How to obtain the inverse and the determinant of a real symmetric matrix
* Cubic spline
* Tridiagonal matrix decomposition   (project 1)
* Householder's tridiagonalization technique and finding eigenvalues based on this
* Jacobi's method for finding eigenvalues (project 2)

!split
===== Monte Carlo methods in physics (Chapters 11, 12 and 13) =====
* Random walks and Markov chains
* Metropolis algorithm (project 4)
* Applications to statistical physics systems (project 4)


!split
===== Ordinary differential equations (Chapter 8) =====

* Euler's method and improved Euler's method, truncation errors (projects 3 and 4)
* Runge Kutta methods, 2nd and 4th order, truncation errors (projects 3 and 4)
* Leap-frog and Verlet algoritm (projects 3 and 4)
* How to implement and solve a second-order differential equation,  both linear and non-linear.
* How to make your equations dimensionless.

!split
===== Partial differential equations, chapter 10 =====
* Set up diffusion, Poisson and wave equations up to 2 spatial dimensions and time  
* Set up the mathematical model and algorithms for these equations, with boundary and initial conditions. The stability conditions for the diffusion equation.
* Explicit, implicit and Crank-Nicolson schemes, and how to solve them. Remember that they result in triangular matrices (project 4).  
* Diffusion equation in two dimensions.


!split
===== Final presentation =====
* Introduction with motivation
* Give a short overview of the theory and numerical algorithms employed
* Discuss the implementation of your algorithm and how you verified it and validated it
* Present and discuss your results
* Summary, conclusions and perspectives
* Anything else you think is important. Useful to have backup slides

In total your talk should have a duration of 20-25 minutes, but longer is also ok. The style for the final presentation follows very much the way the lay out your reports.
