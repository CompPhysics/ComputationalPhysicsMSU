This folder contains different implementations of a VMC-program. The 
implementations were made to check out the possibilities of interfacing 
C++ with Python, to compare the speeds of the different implementations, 
and to check out parallelisation with PyPar. The parallel versions have 
been tested on the Titan HPC-cluster, and contain jobscripts for Titan. 
If you want to try out the parallel implementations, you will need to 
change some paths in these job scripts.
