TITLE: PHY480 and PHY905 (sec 002) preliminary survey
AUTHOR: Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University

An essential part of this course is to enable you to do science via numerical experiments and develop projects which allow you to study complex systems. The aim is to enhance what we call algorithmic thinking. With algorithm we mean a finite set of unambiguous instructions that, given some set of initial conditions, can be performed in a prescribed sequence to achieve a certain goal.

_Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing algorithmic thinking when solving problems._

And this  competence is about:

* derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms
* understanding what can go wrong with algorithms
* overview of important, known algorithms
* understanding how algorithms are used to solve complicated problems
* reproducible science and ethics
* algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems

All these elements (and many more) will hopefully aid you in maturing and gaining a better understanding of the scientific process *per se*.    _Writing good reports is a central element in achieving such insights_.
When we use the words computing or computations in this course, it is the above topics we have in mind. 

What follows here are some simple questions about your computing competences, your background and your interests. Hopefully this information will allow us to tailor the course to your interests and background.
