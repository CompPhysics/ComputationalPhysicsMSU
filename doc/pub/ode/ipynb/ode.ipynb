    "Unit Testing is the practice of testing the smallest testable parts,\n",
    "called units, of an application individually and independently to\n",
    "determine if they behave exactly as expected. Unit tests (short code\n",
    "fragments) are usually written such that they can be performed at any\n",
    "time during the development to continually verify the behavior of the\n",
    "code. In this way, possible bugs will be identified early in the\n",
    "development cycle, making the debugging at later stage much\n",
    "easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unit tests with [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch)\n",
    "There are many benefits associated with Unit Testing since it  increases confidence in changing and maintaining code. Big changes can be made to the code quickly, since the tests will ensure that everything still is working properly.\n",
    " * Since the code needs to be modular to make Unit Testing possible, the code will be easier to reuse. This improves the code design.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Debugging is easier, since when a test fails, only the latest changes need to be debugged.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Different parts of a project can be tested without the need to wait for the other parts to be available.\n",
    "\n",
    " * A unit test can serve as a documentation on the functionality of a unit of the code.\n",
