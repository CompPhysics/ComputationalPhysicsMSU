    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to develop your own code for solving eigenvalue problems. The matrix to diagonalize is the same as the one we encountered in project one, a so-called tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix. This matrix has analytical eigenpairs (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) and gives us an excellent testing ground for our algorithms. In this project we will develop an eigenvalue solver based on Jacobi's method. The project will also introduce you to units tests and we will compare our results against other eigenvalue solvers (from LAPACK and/or numpy). \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims also at introducing to you the concept of [scaling of equations](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319327259). This means often either making various variables dimensionless or introducing units which are more convenient. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the two-point boundary value problem of a buckling beam or a spring fastened at both ends. This is one of the problems which has analytical solutions. Thereafter, by simply adding a new variable along the diagonal elements, we can study quantum mechanical problems. In particular, we will study the harmonic oscillator problem in three dimensions, with one or two electrons. For the latter case we can study the role of the repulsive Coulomb interaction and extract interesting physics results. For selected frequencies, even this interacting two-electron problem exhibits analytical solutions, see [M. Taut, Phys. Rev. A 48, 3561 (1993)](http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v48/i5/p3561_1).\n",

Furthermore, for a known simple matrix, irrespective of changes made, we should always get the same and correct eigenvalues. Another test is to make sure that the orthogonality shown in exercise (a) is preserved. Try to figure out other tests your code should pass, based either on the mathematical properties of the algorithms or more program specific tests.

    "\n",
    "  * Describe the algorithm you have used and/or developed. Here you may find it convenient to use pseudocoding. In many cases you can describe the algorithm in the program itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Include the source code of your program. Comment your program properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If possible, try to find analytic solutions, or known limits in order to test your program when developing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to        label your results. All tables and figures should have relevant captions        and labels on the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to give an interpretation of you results in your answers to  the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Critique: if possible include your comments and reflections about the  exercise, whether you felt you learnt something, ideas for improvements and  other thoughts you've made when solving the exercise. We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to establish a practice where you log your work at the  computerlab. You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did. Here you could also record  the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Format for electronic delivery of report and programs\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred format for the report is a PDF file. You can also use DOC or postscript formats or as an ipython notebook file.  As programming language we prefer that you choose between C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python. The following prescription should be followed when preparing the report:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use your github repository to upload your report. Indicate where the report is by creating for example a **Report** folder. Please send us as soon as possible your github username.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Place your programs in a folder called for example **Programs** or **src**, in order to indicate where your programs are. You can use a README file to tell us how your github folders are organized. \n",
    "\n",
    "  * In your git repository, please include a folder which contains selected results. These can be in the form of output from your code for a selected set of runs and input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In this and all later projects, you should include tests (for example unit tests) of your code(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Comments  from us on your projects, with score and detailed feedback will be emailed to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, \n",
    "we encourage you to work two and two together. Optimal working groups consist of \n",
    "2-3 students. You can then hand in a common report."
