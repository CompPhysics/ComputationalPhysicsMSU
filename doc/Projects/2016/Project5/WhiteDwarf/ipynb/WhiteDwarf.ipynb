    "## Theoretical background and description of the physical system\n",
    "\n",
    "This project contains a long description of the physics of compact objects such as white dwarfs.\n",
    "It serves as a background for understanding the final differential equations you need to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "White dwarfs are cold objects which consist mainly of heavy nuclei such as $^{56}$Fe, with 26 protons, 30 neutrons\n",
    "and  their respective electrons.  Charge equilibrium results in an equal quantity of electrons and protons.\n",
    "You can read more about white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes at the website of the\n",
    "[Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics](http://www.jinaweb.org) or [NASA's website](http://www.nasa.org).\n",
    "These stars are the endpoints of stars with masses of the size or smaller than our sun. \n",
    "They are the outcome of standard nuclear processes and end their lives as \n",
    "cold objects like white dwarfs when they have used up all their nuclear fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where a star ends up at the end of its life depends on the mass, or amount of matter, it was born with. \n",
    "Stars that have a lot of mass may end their lives as black holes or neutron stars. Low and medium mass stars \n",
    "will become something called a white dwarf. A typical white dwarf is half as massive as the Sun, yet \n",
    "only slightly bigger than the Earth. This makes white dwarfs one of the densest forms of matter, surpassed only by neutron stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medium mass stars, like our Sun, live by burning the hydrogen that dwells within their cores, \n",
    "turning it into helium. This is what our Sun is doing now. The heat the Sun generates by its \n",
    "nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium creates an outward pressure. In another 5 billion years, \n",
    "the Sun will have used up all the hydrogen in its core.\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation in a star is similar to a pressure cooker. Heating something \n",
    "in a sealed container causes a build up in pressure. The same thing happens in the Sun. \n",
    "Although the Sun may not strictly be a sealed container, gravity causes it to act like one, pulling the \n",
    "star inward, while the pressure created by the hot gas in the core pushes to get out. \n",
    "The balance between pressure and gravity is very delicate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because a white dwarf is no longer able to create internal pressure, gravity unopposedly crushes \n",
    "it down until even the very electrons that make up a white dwarf's atoms are mashed together. \n",
    "In normal circumstances, identical electrons (those with the same \"spin\") are not allowed to occupy the same energy level. \n",
    "Since there are only two ways an electron can spin, only two electrons can occupy a single energy level. \n",
    "This is what's know in physics as the Pauli Exclusion Principle. And in a normal gas, this isn't a problem; \n",
    "there aren't enough electrons floating around to completely fill up all the energy levels. But in a white dwarf, \n",
    "all of its electrons are forced close together; soon all the energy levels in its atoms are filled up with electrons. \n",
    "If all the energy levels are filled, and it is impossible to put more than two electrons in each level, \n",
    "then our white dwarf has become degenerate. For gravity to compress the white dwarf anymore, \n",
    "it must force electrons where they cannot go. Once a star is degenerate, gravity cannot compress it any more \n",
    "because quantum mechanics tells us there is no more available space to be taken up. So our white dwarf survives, \n",
    "not by internal combustion, but by quantum mechanical principles that prevent its complete collapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With a surface gravity of 100000 times that of the earth, the atmosphere of \n",
    "a white dwarf is very strange. The heavier atoms in its atmosphere sink and the lighter ones remain at the surface. \n",
    "Some white dwarfs have almost pure hydrogen or helium atmospheres, the lightest of elements. \n",
    "Also, the very strong gravity pulls the atmosphere close around it in a very thin layer, that, \n",
    "if were it on earth, would be lower than the tops of our skyscrapers!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equilibrium equations\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the star is in thermal equilibrium. It exhibits also charge equilibrium, meaning the number of electrons has to balance the number of protons. The gravitational pull \n",
    "on every element of volume is balanced by the pressure set up by a degenerate gas of electrons\n",
    "at $T=0$, since the temperature of the star is well below the so-called Fermi temperature of the \n",
    "electrons. \n",
    "The electrons are assumed to be relativistic and since the protons and neutrons have much lower\n",
    "kinetic energy, we assume that the pressure which balances the gravitational force is mainly\n",
    "set up by the relativistic electrons. The kinetic energy of the electrons is also much larger\n",
    "than the electron-electron repulsion or the attraction from the nuclei. This means that we can treat \n",
    "the system as a gas of free degenerate electrons at $T=0$ moving in between a lattice of nuclei like  \n",
    "iron. This is our ansatz. \n",
    "Based on this we can derive the pressure which counterbalances the gravitational force given by\n",

    "  * Give a short description of the nature of the problem and the eventual  numerical methods you have used.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Describe the algorithm you have used and/or developed. Here you may find it convenient to use pseudocoding. In many cases you can describe the algorithm in the program itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Include the source code of your program. Comment your program properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If possible, try to find analytic solutions, or known limits in order to test your program when developing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to        label your results. All tables and figures should have relevant captions        and labels on the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to give an interpretation of you results in your answers to  the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Critique: if possible include your comments and reflections about the  exercise, whether you felt you learnt something, ideas for improvements and  other thoughts you've made when solving the exercise. We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to establish a practice where you log your work at the  computerlab. You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did. Here you could also record  the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning.\n",

    "## Format for electronic delivery of report and programs\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred format for the report is a PDF file. You can also use DOC or postscript formats or as an ipython notebook file.  As programming language we prefer that you choose between C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python. The following prescription should be followed when preparing the report:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use your github repository to upload your report. Indicate where the report is by creating for example a **Report** folder. Please send us as soon as possible your github username.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Place your programs in a folder called for example **Programs** or **src**, in order to indicate where your programs are. You can use a README file to tell us how your github folders are organized. \n",
    "\n",
    "  * In your git repository, please include a folder which contains selected results. These can be in the form of output from your code for a selected set of runs and input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In this and all later projects, you should include tests (for example unit tests) of your code(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Comments  from us on your projects, with score and detailed feedback will be emailed to you. \n",
    "\n",
